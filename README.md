# Introduction
This project is a stickman platformer game. First the user has to start the game using the IR remote to navigate the menu screen. Once the start is activated, the user will be launched into one of 5 stages and will be able to control the vertical and horizontal movement of a stickman character. The goal of each stage is for the character to reach an orb using platforms which on touch will complete the level. Some challenges are that there are time constrictions and pitfalls that will stop the game when activated. The final score is proportionally attributed to the number of levels the user has completed (Ex: completed stage 3, but not stage 4, score will be 3).
